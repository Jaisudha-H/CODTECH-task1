**Objectives**

Here are some objectives you might consider:

Assess Complexity: Evaluate the combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.

Length Evaluation: Encourage a minimum length (e.g., 12 characters) for passwords, as longer passwords are generally more secure.

Common Password Detection: Check against a database of commonly used passwords to discourage users from selecting weak options.

**Purpose**

The primary goal is to help users create strong, secure passwords that reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their accounts.

**Keys Features**

Complexity Assessment: Analyzes the mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) to gauge complexity.

Length Recommendations: Emphasizes the importance of longer passwords, typically recommending a minimum of 12 characters.

Common Password Identification: Flags passwords that are commonly used or easily guessable, encouraging users to avoid them.
